Operating Systems   Project 3  
University at Albany
Department of Computer Science
CSI 500
Purpose of the Project
The goal of this exercise is to gain an understanding of distributed processing by extending the functionality of a simple Linux shell behavior. The system to be created will be able to manipulate the contents stored in other machines that share a network connection. 

The Details
Your solution must modify the file redirect capabilities of the standard Linux shell to allow both the input and the output of shell commands to be redirected to different machines connected through a shared network. Your solution may combine the code you developed for both project1 and assignment 2. The following syntax is to be followed by your new redirect command:
    1. commands >@s port-number
The result of commands will be redirected to server s with the provided port number.
    2. commands <@s port-number
Similar to previous command but for input data.
    3. commands >@c server-host-name.port-number
The result of commands will be redirected to client c with host name and number as provided.
    4. commands <@c server-host-name.port-number
Similar to previous command but for input data.

Due Date
The project is due through Blackboard by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, April 22nd, 2020. 
Expectation

        a. Title page
        b. A table of contents
        c. [20%] System documentation
            i. A high-level data flow diagram for the system
            ii. A list of routines and their brief descriptions
            iii. Implementation details
        d. [5%] Test documentation
            i. How you tested your program
            ii. Testing outputs
        e. [5%] User documentation
            i. Where is your source
            ii. How to run your program
            iii. Describe parameter (if any)

    2. Source Code
